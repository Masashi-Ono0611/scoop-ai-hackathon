# 🚀 Scoop AI Hackathon Tokyo Bowl
Hosted by: Neo × SpoonOS × IFSTAGE

## Event Overview

🤖 The globally recognized Scoop AI Hackathon series, themed around AI × Web3, is coming to Japan for the first time.

Neo Scoop AI Con Tokyo 2026 is a one-day, offline, idea-friendly hackathon that values ideas, experimentation, and sharing over polished final products.

You can:
- Focus on building
- Or organize your ideas and present them
- Or simply explore and learn with others interested in Web3 and AI

Beginners and experienced participants are equally welcome. “Try it first” or “start from an idea” — both are perfectly valid ways to join.

🍽 Catering and drinks will be provided on the event day.

## Theme: AI Agents × Web3

We explore how AI can evolve beyond being a tool to an entity capable of decision-making, execution, and collaboration, and how such agents can integrate into society, products, and communities.
